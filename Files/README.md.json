This is the app's **main process**.\n- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.\n\nYou can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).\n\n## To Use\n\nTo clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repository\ngit clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\n# Go into the repository\ncd electron-quick-start\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n# Run the app\nnpm start\n```\n\nNote: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.\n\n## Resources for Learning Electron\n\n- [electronjs.org/docs](https://electronjs.org/docs) - all of Electron's documentation\n- [electronjs.org/community#boilerplates](https://electronjs.org/community#boilerplates) - sample starter apps created by the community\n- [electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) - a very basic starter Electron app\n- [electron/simple-samples](https://github.com/electron/simple-samples) - small applications with ideas for taking them further\n- [electron/electron-api-demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos) - an Electron app that teaches you how to use Electron\n- [hokein/electron-sample-apps](https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps) - small demo apps for the various Electron APIs\n\n## License\n\n[CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)](LICENSE.md)\n"
